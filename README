Welcome to the simple banner watcher!

To use this, you will need to do a few things:
1. change the CRN and DIR variables in setup.sh and script.sh
2. enter your email information in mailUpdate.py
3. run setup.sh
4. place script.sh in a chronjob


After that, you should recieve emails when the status of your class changes.
If you would like to recieve text messages, change the addr variable in mailUpdate.py to mail to your favorite email-to-textmessage service (many major carriers have emails for this purpose)
